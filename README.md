Install
=======

### Boxed version (single executable file)

Replace `FFX&X-2_LAUNCHER.exe` in the `FINAL FANTASY FFX&FFX-2 HD Remaster` folder.

‚ö†Ô∏è Does not work on Linux (proton) as of this writing.

### Extract and replace file

Extract `./FINAL FANTASY FFX&FFX-2 HD Remaster/` archive content into the `FINAL FANTASY FFX&FFX-2 HD Remaster` game folder.

üí° If you find it a bit messy consider the symlink method down below.

### Symlink

Extract `./FINAL FANTASY FFX&FFX-2 HD Remaster/` archive content into any folder like for example `FINAL FANTASY FFX&FFX-2 HD Remaster/launcher`

Inside the `FINAL FANTASY FFX&FFX-2 HD Remaster` game folder symlink `FFX&X-2_LAUNCHER.exe` with `launcher/FFX&X-2_LAUNCHER.exe`

‚ö†Ô∏è NB: As of this writing the Steam client (Windows & Linux) does not follow symlink ! Using this method you will have to manually start the game.

Controls
========

#### GAMEPAD

- `D-pad/Left Analog Stick`: Navigate / Change setting
- `A Button`: Select
- `B Button`: Previous menu
- `Start / Options Button`: Enter settings

Command line
============

By default the launcher will look for game's files next to itself.

If for whatever reason(s) you would like to change this, you can either

- Use the `--gamePath` argument

```
FFX&X-2_LAUNCHER.exe --gamePath="path\to\game\dir"
```

- or set the env variable `GAMEPATH`

```
GAMEPATH=path\to\game\dir
```

Build
=====

- Node.js / NPM
- C/C++ build tools and Python 3.x (node-gyp)
- git
  
```
git clone https://github.com/xan105/FFX-X2_LAUNCHER.git && cd FFX-X2_LAUNCHER
npm ci --arch=ia32 
npm run-script build
```

‚úîÔ∏è Application can be found in the `./dist` folder.

NB: The boxed version (single executable file) is made by using [Enigma Virtual Box](https://enigmaprotector.com/en/aboutvb.html):
its `.evb` project file is located in the `./build` folder (üí° it's just a xml file).
